### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felipe!
I value the well-being of those around me, I always try to solve the problems presented to me in a fair and assertive way.

I have experience in fraud analysis in the mobile telephony segment, where I worked seeking to solve, prevent, and correct possible frauds together with consumer protection agencies, Anatel and/or Procon.

I volunteered for 2 years in a support service for families and young people looking for a better way to progress in spiritual and secular environments. in 8 months of service as a volunteer I was called to work in the association's office where I was responsible for coordinating expenses, receipts, reimbursements, accounts payable, and logistical processes of moving and transferring volunteers in the field.
